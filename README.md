# üê∫ QA Wolf Take-Home Assignment

I didn't pass the assessment, and I revisited it to see if I could come up with a better solution, but I'm not sure if it aligns with the expected solution. I think the new version aligns even less. I got to use Playwright!

### Question 1

In this task, you'll create a script for [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) using JavaScript and Microsoft‚Äôs [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) framework.

1. Install node modules by running `npm i`.
2. Edit the `index.js` file in this project to navigate to [Hacker News/newest](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest) and validate that EXACTLY the first 100 articles are sorted from newest to oldest. You can run your script with the `node index.js` command.

Feel free to update Playwright or install additional packages as needed; however, you must use Playwright in this assignment.
